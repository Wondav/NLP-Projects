Contains deep learning projects in NLP


### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis aka opinion mining is the process of understanding the opinion of a subject about an object.
* The Sentiment Analysis project was implemented using Naive Bayes Classifier, RNN -> LSTM & GRU, and Pre-trained BERT model
* The Pre-trained BERT model was fine-tuned and deployed on AWS Sagemaker.

### Punctuation Restoration
Punctuation Restoration is the application of machine learning techniques to automate the punctuation of a disfluent paragraph of text. It is majorly used to punctuate the output of Automatic Speech Recognition System, so it can be readable by humans, and used for other NLP Tasks.
* Used Amazon Sagemaker experiments to track the model training on different algorithms.
* Utilized Amazon Sagemaker Pipeline for data processing, model training, and model evaluation, and Amazon Sagemaker Model Registry to store model artifacts.
* Utilized Amazon Sagemaker Endpoints to deploy the model

### Text Summarization

### Neural Machine Translation(NMT)
Neural Machine Translation is training your computer to translate human languages e.g. From English to French, 
or English to yoruba

### Speech to text Summarization
